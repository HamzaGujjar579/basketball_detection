# Basketball Detection Model Project

This repository contains code and resources for training a basketball detection model and converting it for mobile deployment (ONNX, TFLite, Core ML).

## Features

- **Model Training:** Scripts and notebooks for training a basketball detection model.
- **Model Conversion:** Tools to convert trained models to mobile-friendly formats:
  - TensorFlow Lite (`.tflite`)
  - ONNX (`.onnx`)
  - Core ML (`.mlpackage`)
- **Metadata Inspection:** Utility to inspect TFLite model input/output details.

```

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Prepare Dataset**

   Place your basketball images/videos in the `data/` folder and update preprocessing scripts as needed.

3. **Train the Model**

   Run training scripts in the `train/` folder. Example:

   ```sh
   python train/train_model.py
   ```

4. **Convert the Model**

   Use scripts in the `convert/` folder to export your trained model to TFLite, ONNX, or Core ML formats.

   Example (TFLite):

   ```sh
   python convert/to_tflite.py
   ```

5. **Inspect Model Metadata**

   Use `metadata.py` to view input/output details of your TFLite model:

   ```sh
   python metadata.py
   ```
